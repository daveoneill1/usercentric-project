## DAO Traditional Chinese Medicine

## Introduction
<hr>

Caitriona O'Neill is a recently qualified Chinese Medicine practitioner and the name of her practice is DAO Chinese Medicine. The business is currently promoted online through a Facebook page. Caitriona wanted a web presence and the aim of the project was to creae a website that represented the brand she is trying to build. The brand guidelines for design were simplicity, airy and clean. 

The client would like to be able to expand the website to include new pages including a blog, and faq in the future. 




## User Experience

This website is for clients who are interested in finding out more about DAO Traditional Chinese Medicine. In the long term Caitriona would like to use the website to turn potential clients who are thinking about TCM into customers who will attend the clinic. TCM is an equivalent to western medicince and used by 40% of the World's population. The target market for the service is therefore broad.
